# predicting-crew-size

Write-up provided in [explore.ipynb](explore.ipynb).

## Objective
Build a regressor that recommends the “crew” size for potential ship buyers.

## Instructions
1. Read the file and display columns.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis. Calculate basic statistics of the data (count, mean,
std, etc), examine the data, and state your observations.
3. Use one-hot encoding for categorical features that you might include in your model.
4. Select the columns that will probably be important to predict crew size and explain your
rationale.
a. If you remove columns, explain why.
5. Create training and testing sets (recommended 60% for training and remainder for
testing).
a. If training and testing sets differ from recommendation, explain why
6. Build a machine learning model/models to predict crew size.
7. Calculate the appropriate model performance metric(s) for your model(s).
8. Describe hyper-parameters in your model and how you would change them to improve
the performance of the model. Tune the hyper-parameters (if necessary) and select the
best model.
9. Describe what regularization is. What is the regularization parameter in your model?
10. Plot the regularization parameter value vs. your chosen performance metric for the test
and training sets and comment on whether your model has bias, variance or other
issues.
